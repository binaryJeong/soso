<p>From this point he marched two stages—ten parasangs—to the river Psarus, which is two hundred feet broad, and from
    the Psarus he marched a single stage—five parasangs—to Issi, the last city in Cilicia. It lies on the seaboard—a
    prosperous, large and flourishing town. Here they halted three days, and here Cyrus was joined by his fleet. There
    were thirty-five ships from Peloponnesus, with the Lacedaemonian admiral Pythagoras on board. These had been piloted
    from Ephesus by Tamos the Egyptian, who himself had another fleet of twenty-five ships belonging to Cyrus. These had
    formed Tamos's blockading squadron at Miletus, when that city sided with Tissaphernes; he had also used them in
    other military services rendered to Cyrus in his operations against that satrap. There was a third officer on board
    the fleet, the Lacedaemonian Cheirisophus, who had been sent for by Cyrus, and had brought with him seven hundred
    hoplites, over whom he was to act as general in the service of Cyrus. The fleet lay at anchor opposite Cyrus's tent.
    Here too another reinforcement presented itself. This was a body of four hundred hoplites, Hellenic mercenaries in
    the service of Abrocomas, who deserted him for Cyrus, and joined in the campaign against the king.</p>
<p>From Issi, he marched a single stage—five parasangs—to the gates of Cilicia and Syria. This was a double fortress:
    the inner and nearer one, which protects Cilicia, was held by Syennesis and a garrison of Cilicians; the outer and
    further one, protecting Syria, was reported to be garrisoned by a body of the king's troops. Through the gap between
    the two fortresses flows a river named the Carsus, which is a hundred feet broad, and the whole space between was
    scarcely more than six hundred yards. To force a passage here would be impossible, so narrow was the pass itself,
    with the fortification walls stretching down to the sea, and precipitous rocks above; while both fortresses were
    furnished with gates. It was the existence of this pass which had induced Cyrus to send for the fleet, so as to
    enable him to lead a body of hoplites inside and outside the gates; and so to force a passage through the enemy, if
    he were guarding the Syrian gate, as he fully expected to find Abrocomas doing with a large army. This, however,
    Abrocomas had not done; but as soon as he learnt that Cyrus was in Cilicia, he had turned round and made his exit
    from Phoenicia, to join the king with an army amounting, as report said, to three hundred thousand men.</p>
